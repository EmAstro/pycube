PSF reconstruction
==================

Directly from the source
------------------------

An empirical model of the PSF can directly created from the source light (if unresolved, such as in the case of
high redshift quasars) by summing up spectral regions virtually free of any extended emission.
This can be achieved by using the psf class of the package.
